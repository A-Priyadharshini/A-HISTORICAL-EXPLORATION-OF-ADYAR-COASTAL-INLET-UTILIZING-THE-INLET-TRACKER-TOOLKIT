# A-HISTORICAL-EXPLORATION-OF-ADYAR-COASTAL-INLET-UTILIZING-THE-INLET-TRACKER-TOOLKIT
Coastal inlets, shaped by natural processes, connect various coastal features. The Inlet Tracker, developed by Valentin Heimhuber, uses Google Earth Engine and Python to analyze coastal conditions and track long-term changes.
## About
Coastal inlets, shaped by natural forces like river flow and storm activity, link back barrier bays, lagoons, and marshes to the ocean. Maintained by tidal currents, they hold ecological and socio-economic significance. However, understanding their long-term changes remains limited. The Inlet Tracker, developed by Valentin Heimhuber in 2021, employs Google Earth Engine and Python to analyze coastal berms. This tool identifies if inlets are open or closed and tracks their evolution over time. It offers insights into these dynamic environments, crucial for managing coastal resources and mitigating risks associated with changing inlet conditions.
### Features
The Coastal InletTracker project integrates cutting-edge technology like Google Earth Engine and Python, enabling sophisticated pathfinding analyses along coastal berms. 

It delivers a comprehensive assessment of inlet conditions, tracking their evolution over time. Leveraging remote sensing data, it provides real-time or near-real-time monitoring, facilitating prompt responses to changes. 

The tool offers insights into the ecological and socio-economic significance of coastal inlets, aiding in resource management. With a user-friendly interface, it caters to diverse stakeholders, fostering data-driven decision-making. Overall, the InletTracker represents a significant advancement in understanding and managing coastal environments, offering valuable insights into inlet dynamics.

###### Results and Impact
InletTracker adeptly traces dynamic inlet channels along coastal berms, showcased through selected LANDSAT images of the Adyar River inlet. 

It accurately identifies paths, particularly around bottleneck areas, revealing variability in inlet openings. Utilizing Landsat 8 imagery and NDWI configuration, it offers insights into inlet conditions and dynamics from 1990 to present.

Despite limitations in transitional phases, it supports global inlet management and research initiatives, complementing on-ground surveys.

Its adaptability extends to analyzing various shallow water landforms, aiding in understanding long-term morphodynamics and identifying key drivers such as climate change impacts. 

Overall, InletTracker provides a robust tool for monitoring and managing coastal inlets.
